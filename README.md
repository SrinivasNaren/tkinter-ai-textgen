## âœ¨ Features

âœ… Simple & Clean Desktop GUI (Tkinter)  
âœ… Uses **Hugging Face Transformers** (DistilBERT model)  
âœ… Instant Sentiment Prediction (Positive / Negative)  
âœ… Beginner-friendly Codebase ðŸ’»  
âœ… Great First AI + ML Project ðŸŽ¯

## ðŸ“– Before & After Transformers (Explained Simply)

ðŸ”¹ **Before Transformers:**  
- Models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, RNNs.  
- Needed **manual preprocessing** (stopwords, stemming).  
- Couldnâ€™t understand context (e.g., "not good" was treated as "good").  

ðŸ”¹ **After Transformers (BERT, DistilBERT, GPT):**  
- Understand **context & meaning** of words.  
- Pre-trained on huge datasets â†’ works out of the box.  
- Much higher accuracy and faster to deploy.  

ðŸ‘‰ Weâ€™re using **DistilBERT**: a smaller, faster, but powerful version of BERT.  

ðŸ”— Model Used: [DistilBERT SST-2](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english)

## ðŸŽ¬ Live Demo (Steps)

1. Type: *I love this project!*
   â†’ Output: **Positive ðŸ˜€**

2. Type: *This is the worst experience ever.*
   â†’ Output: **Negative ðŸ˜¡**

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. User enters text in the **Tkinter GUI**.
2. Hugging Face **pipeline** loads `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`.
3. Model predicts sentiment (Positive / Negative) with a confidence score.
4. Result displayed on screen.
