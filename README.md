# 🤖 Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT  

A simple yet powerful **sentiment analysis web app** built using **DistilBERT** from Hugging Face.  
This app allows you to enter text and instantly see whether the sentiment is **Positive 😀** or **Negative 😡**.

## 📖 Before & After Transformers (In Simple Words)

🔹 **Before Transformers (Old days):**  
We used traditional ML models like Naive Bayes, SVM, or RNNs/LSTMs.  
They worked… but:  
- Needed a lot of feature engineering (manual word cleaning, stopwords, etc.)  
- Struggled with long sentences and context.  
- Training was slow and less accurate.  

🔹 **After Transformers (Now):**  
Models like **BERT, DistilBERT, GPT** changed everything:  
- They understand **context** (e.g., “not good” is negative, not positive).  
- Pre-trained on massive text data → need only fine-tuning for tasks.  
- Faster, more accurate, and widely adopted.  

👉 That’s why we’re using **DistilBERT**, a lightweight and fast version of BERT, perfect for real-world apps.

## 🔗 Model Used

We used the **DistilBERT fine-tuned on SST-2 (sentiment dataset)**:

## ⚡ Features  

✅ Enter any sentence and get instant sentiment prediction.  
✅ Runs on your browser after starting the app.  
✅ Uses Hugging Face Transformers library.  
✅ Lightweight and beginner-friendly codebase.

## 🛠 Installation  

Clone the repo and install dependencies:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-distilbert-app.git
cd sentiment-distilbert-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## 🚀 Running the App

Start the app with:

```bash
python app.py
```

👉 A **new browser tab** will automatically open showing the demo.

By default, it runs on:

* `http://127.0.0.1:5000` → Flask/FastAPI
* `http://127.0.0.1:8501` → Streamlit

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Input Text** → User enters a sentence.
2. **Tokenizer** → Text is converted into tokens (numbers).
3. **DistilBERT Model** → Predicts sentiment (positive/negative).
4. **Output** → Result displayed on the web page instantly.
